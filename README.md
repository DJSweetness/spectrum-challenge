# spectrum-challenge

Please visit: https://djsweetness.github.io/spectrum-challenge/ to see the challenge solution.

Notes about project:

There were a couple of things I wasn't too sure on, but I think I covered the stories as well as a couple of stretch goals.
* I added unit tests for full coverage of the sorting function
* I added integration tests that test the functionality of adding custom filters, the actual filtering of the data, and the clearing of the filter.
* As you can see in the code, there were no third party libraries used for the table, search functionality, nor the filter functionality.

The files below are probably the meat of the project, but feel free to look around:
* Data Table: https://github.com/DJSweetness/spectrum-challenge/blob/main/src/Components/DataTableComponents/DataTable/DataTable.tsx
* Integration Test: https://github.com/DJSweetness/spectrum-challenge/blob/main/src/Components/App/App.test.tsx
* Unit Test: https://github.com/DJSweetness/spectrum-challenge/blob/main/src/Components/DataTableComponents/DataTable/utils.test.ts
* Fetching Function: https://github.com/DJSweetness/spectrum-challenge/blob/main/src/API/fetchRestaurantData.tsx

I hope you enjoy!
