Notes about project:

There were a couple of things I wasn't too sure on, but I think I covered the stories as well as a couple of stretch goals.
* I added unit tests for full coverage of the sorting function
* I added integration tests that test the functionality of adding custom filters, the actual filtering of the data, and the clearing of the filter.
* As you can see in the code, there were no third party libraries used for the table, search functionality, nor the filter functionality.

I hope you enjoy!
